# CALENDAR

## Description
Calendar demo project with Angular 8 and Bootstrap

## How to use
- Download the project
- run `npm i`
- run `ng serve -o`

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Features in master branch
- Ability to add reminder
- Display reminders in correct time order
- Allow select color
- Weather service call
- Update reminder: I'm sorry for not creating a generic modal component, I'm using ng bootstrap, that was a
  wrong decision, that library makes very difficult to open the modal from another component, and I didn't have time to change that. I usually use angular material and that problem doesn't exists.
- Some unit testing in the home.spec.ts

## Features in develop branch
- Same as master
- The idea was to show that I know how to work using git flow strategy, but I didn't have time to add 
  the extra features you request. Anyway, you can see in the repo every feature in its own branch.
